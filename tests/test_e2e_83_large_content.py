"""E2E-83 regression tests.

The bug: ``ModelPool.__init__`` initialized the litellm Router with
``optional_pre_call_checks=['enforce_model_rate_limits']``. This is a
litellm built-in that maintains a per-model RPM token bucket and
synchronously raises ``litellm.RouterRateLimitError`` when the
bucket is empty.

For a typical OL setup with NVIDIA free-tier models
(``requests_per_minute: 40``), a single large request (~14s, 26K
tokens) depletes most of the bucket. The NEXT request, even a small
one, gets rejected by the pre-call check before the actual LLM call
is made.

The fix: drop the ``optional_pre_call_checks`` arg. Per-model RPM
is still set in each ``litellm_params['rpm']`` entry, but the
rejection now comes from the provider's HTTP 429 (handled by the
existing translate() exponential backoff) instead of from
litellm's in-process bucket.
